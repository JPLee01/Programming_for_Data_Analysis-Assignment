**Programming for Data Analysis:** *numpy.random* package in Python

A Jupyter Notebook has been created to explain the *numpy.random* package in Python. This notebook will explain the packages use and detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package, as well as the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers for the Programming of Data Analysis Assignment.

**Lecturer:** Dr. Brian McGinley

## 1 Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis of *numpy.random* package in Python has been carried out as
an assignment of the Programming for Data Analysis module. The aim of this
assignment is to help the student gain an understanding of the *numpy.random* package in Python through; detailed explanations of the package, the use of the simple random data and permutations functions, five distributions provided for and the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers. This explanation will be conducted through a Jupyter Notebook which will contain markdown text, images, Python code and Plots. 

## 2 Project Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Project Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the project will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment):

  **File**    |     **Description**

## 4 Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the assignment, the student was given a set of instructions which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/Assignment%20Instructions.pdf). As seen, within the instructions a problem statement was printed. It stated that the following assignment concerns the *numpy.random* package in Python. The student is required to create a Jupyter Notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are also four distinct tasks to be carried out in the Jupyter notebook:
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## 5 User Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section will describe the steps required to download and run the files in the repository.

### 5.1 Downloading the Repository
The repository is stored at the following: https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment

To download the repository, do the following:
1.  Click on the above link to open the repository
2.  Once in the repository, click on the green “clone or download” button on the right side of the screen.
3.  Select "Download ZIP". This will open a prompt allowing you to save the file to a desired location on your computer.
4.  Navigate to where  the ZIP files are located on your computer and extract the compressed (.zip) files.

### 5.2 Running the Program
Once the repository has been downloaded, you will need to ensure that you are running it in the correct environment. It should be noted that this repository has been written using Python 3.8.2 and consequently it will require a Python version of 3.7 at a minimum to run as designed. The repository also requires a number of external Python libraries [seen below](#5.3-Libaries) to execute correctly. Once the correct version of Python has been installed complete with necessary libraries and the ZIP has been downloaded and extracted the user can run the program. The running of any of the programs from the command line can be executed as follows:
1.  Open a command prompt (cmd) or equivalent on your computer.([Cmdr](https://cmder.net) is recommended for Windows computers, Mac Computers via the terminal)
2.  Navigate to the desired location through the use of the change directory (cd) command.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook by typing the following at the command prompt (do not close the command prompt window throughout):
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. A window or tab should open in your default web browser. If this does not happen, read the command prompt output. It should provide a URL which you can copy and paste into your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.
6. Using the menu on the left side of the page, double click the jupyter notebook file:
```
Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb
```
7. The notebook should open in a new tab. You can run each cell with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ENTER, alternatively use the "play" button on the menu bar. Please note that certain cells must be run before others e.g. the cells importing the various Python libraries. You may find it convenient to use the "Run all Cells" option in the "Run" dropdown menu.


### 5.3 Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in the writing of the programs code and are required to successfully run the programs:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) - The *numpy.random* library is the subject of the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb) notebook and its functions are extensively used throughout.
* [Matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) - Used for the manipulation of elements and the creation of certain plots graphs and plots within the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb) notebook.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Used for the creation and manipulation of all plots in the [Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment.ipynb) notebook (Seaborn allows for the extetion of the functionality of Matplotlib).
